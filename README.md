This is a php + mysql solution for vaccination management. The aim is to enable paperless vaccination management for
pediatricians along with providing certain benefits for the patient (such as vaccination reminders, personalized schedule).

The main thing setting this solution apart from others is the ability to send messages to patients regarding vaccination/upcoming visits/birthdays/out of station messages automatically **without any limit on the number of messages**. This is because your own Android device can be configured to send these automated messages on your behalf and no third-party SMS service is required.
