This is a php + mysql solution for vaccination management. The aim is to enable paperless vaccination management for
pediatricians along with providing certain benefits for the patient (such as vaccination reminders, personalized schedule).

The main thing setting this solution apart from others is the automatic schedule generation. Other solutions generally require
the doctor to enter vaccination dates which is just not feasible.
